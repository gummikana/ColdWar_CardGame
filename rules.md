Your turn is over and the turn passes to the player on your left.

1. Start a project
------------------

Take a card from your hand and place it _face down_ in front of you and don't show it to any of the other players. At any time you can only have 5 projects in front of you. 

You may also scrap any of projects you've got in front of you. Take the to be scrapped project, turn it face up and place it in the discard pile. The workers (if any) are returned back to the worker reserve. 

2. Deploy workers

3. Complete a Project
---------------------

You can complete a project once it's got enough workers to pay for it's flipping up cost. After that resolve the effects on the cards.
