Setup
=====

Take the victory point deck and shuffle it. Deal 5 victory point cards to each player face down. 

Take all the workers (wooden discs) and place them in a convenient place in reach of both players. This is the Worker Pool.

Both players take their own decks and shuffle them. Each players deals themselves 2 cards. These are the starting hands. 

How to play
===========
 
Cold War is played in turns. The starting players does their actions first and then it's the other player. 


Taking a turn
-------------

At the very beginning of your turn you may choose to start the Nuclear War. See Nuclear War section.

If no Nuclear War was announced continue your turn in the following order:

Draw 2 more cards and take 2 more workers.

Then you can do any of the following in any order as many times as you want or can. 

1. Start a project
2. Deploy workers 
3. Complete a project

After this comes the discard phase. If you have more than 6 cards in your hand you have to discard cards from your hand until you have 6 cards.

Your turn is over and the turn passes to the player on your left.

1. Start a project
------------------

Take a card from your hand and place it _face down_ in front of you and don't show it to any of the other players. At any time you can only have 5 projects in front of you. 

You may also scrap any of projects you've got in front of you. Take the to be scrapped project, turn it face up and place it in the discard pile. The workers (if any) are returned back to the worker reserve. 

2. Deploy workers
-----------------

Every turn you get 2 new workers (3 if you have the Nuclear Power completed). You may place these 2 workers on any of the projects you have face down in front of you. In any order. You can place as many workers on a _face down_ card as you want (even exceeding the Max Workers value).

Note that you cannot relocate workers. Once it's been deployed it stays there. Also you cannot 'store' workers, if you have no use for your workers that turn then you simply get less workers that turn. 

3. Complete a Project
---------------------

You can complete a project once it's got enough workers to pay for it's flipping up cost. After that resolve the effects on the cards.

Card Types
==========

There 5 types of cards in Cold War.

Peace
-----

The Peace cards can be used to increase the World Peace Counter. This is done by turning the card face up and paying the Flip Over cost by removing that number of workers from the card. The World Peace Counter is increased by the number of workers left on card up to the Max Number of Workers. The card is discarded and all the workers are moved back into the Worker Pool.

Example: Ari's got a United Nations (1/5) face down on his Board. He's got 5 workers on it and he flips it up and pays the Flip Over cost (1) by removing one of the workers. Then he resolves the card, he's got 4 workers left on the card and thus increase the World Peace Counter by 4. He then discards the workers and card from the board.

Victory
-------

Victory cards can be used to gain Victory Points. For every worker past the Flip Over cost up to the Max Number of Workers draw a Victory Point (the mini cards) but don't show the value (face of the card) to your opponent. Discard the Victory card and return the workers to the Worker Pool.

Example: It's Mikko's turn and he plays the Victory Monument (1/3) card from his hand face down on the table. He places the 2 new workers on it and flips it face up paying the Flip Over cost (1). 1 worker remains on the card and Mikko gain's a Victory Point for it. He takes the top card of the Victory Point deck and places it among his victory points face down. He discards the worker and the Victory Monument card.

Nuclear Weapons
---------------

Nuclear Weapons cards are used to gain Nuclear Missiles which can be used to destroy your opponent's cards and Victory Points in the case of Nuclear War (see Nuclear War). This is done by turning the card face up and paying the Flip Over cost by removing that number of workers from the card. The card remains face up and all the rest of the workers up to Max Number of Workers are now Nuclear Missiles. If there are more workers than the Max Number of Workers, these workers are returned to the Worker Pool.

Example: ---

Covert Operation
----------------

Covert Operation cards are used to perform Intelligence gathering, Counter intelligence and Sabotage. To do this turn the card face up and pay the Flip Over cost. Perform the action on the card and then discard the card. 

Counter Intelligence can be used when your opponent is performing a Spy Operation or Sabotage. Turn the card face up and pay the Flip Over cost and this counters the effect of that card.

Production
----------

Production cards can be used to speed up the process constructing projects. Turn the card face up and pay the Flip Over cost and perform the action on the card and then discard the card. Except in the case of Nuclear Power (which is in effect until it is discarded or nuked).


Nuclear War
===========

After Nuclear War has been started there is no turning back. It's fought until the very last Nuclear Missile has been fired. After this both players count their Victory Points and the player with the highest score wins.

Nuclear War may be declared at the beginning of the players turn. The player who declares Nuclear War says out loud that they're starting the Nuclear War. From now on none of the players (including the player who declared Nuclear War) can place any new Workers on the cards nor do they draw more cards nor can they place new cards on the board.

- First player gets to flip 1 card over and deploy a nuke. Also player who declares Nuclear War has to deploy 1 nuke. You can't start a Nuclear War if you don't have any Nuclear Missiles.


On their turns the players can only do _one_ of the following: 
1. Complete a Project
Or 
2. Deploy a Nuclear Missile


1. Complete a Project
---------------------

You can complete a project once it's got enough workers to pay for it's flipping up cost. After that resolve the effects on the cards. See section blah blah  blah.

2. Deploy a Nuclear Missile
---------------------------

Take a Nuclear Missile (a worker on face up Nuclear Weapon card) and use it to either destroy a one of your opponent's face down cards or destroy one of your opponent's Victory Points. 

If you target a face down card, the owner of that card takes the card, turns it face up and discards it and it's workers. If the card can't be destroyed with a Nuke (e.g. Fallout Shelter) the cards is shown to all players and that Nuclear Missile was wasted.

If you target your opponent's Victory Points, your opponent gets to choose which Victory Point he discards (usually he will want to discard the one with the lowest value).


World Peace
===========

If the World Peace counter reaches 10, the game ends at the end of that player's turn when World Peace Counter reached 10. The game ended in World Peace and now both players add up their Victory Points. 

If the Nuclear War has been declarer the game cannot end in World Peace even if the World Peace counter reaches 10.

End of the game
===============

After the game has ended in either the World Peace or in the Nuclear War. The game is considered ended. Neither player can add any more cards nor can they play any. Both players take their Victory Points and add up th values. 

At this point the Fallout Shelter is also scored. It is scored like a normal Victory card by turning face up by paying the Flip Over cost and the rest of the workers up to Max Number of Workers are converted into Victory Points. The players draw that many Victory Points and add those to their final score.

The player with the highest total wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with more workers left on the board wins the game.
